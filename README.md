## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Step Quest is built with React and styled with CSS. The app utilizes local storage to store user progress and step count. The app allows users to set daily step goals, and rewards them with action points for each goal achieved. Users can use their action points to purchase upgrades and items to help them progress through the game.

## Optimizations

Throughout the development process, various optimizations were made to improve the game's performance and user experience. For example, caching assets and optimizing the code for rendering large amounts of data.

## Lessons Learned:

Developing Step Quest was a great learning experience. As a solo developer, I learned how to effectively manage state and store data using local storage. I also learned the importance of optimizing code and caching assets to improve performance. The experience of building Step Quest has given me valuable skills that I can apply to future projects.
